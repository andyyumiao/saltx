==================
What is SaltStack?
==================

SaltStack makes software for complex systems management at scale.
SaltStack is the company that created and maintains the Salt Open
project and develops and sells SaltStack Enterprise software, services
and support. Easy enough to get running in minutes, scalable enough to
manage tens of thousands of servers, and fast enough to communicate with
them in *seconds*.

Salt is a new approach to infrastructure management built on a dynamic
communication bus. Salt can be used for data-driven orchestration,
remote execution for any infrastructure, configuration management for
any app stack, and much more.

安装引导
==================

1.源码直接安装

2.RPM打包

3.RPM安装

4.架构说明


源码安装
===============

* git clone http://git.jd.com/saltstack/salt.git

* 进入/salt/录下，执行./setup.py install，会在/usr/bin/目录下生成salt-maid、saltx、salt-apiv2等启动脚本
* salt-maid：salt-syndic的替代品，运行在salts-syndic节点
* salt-apiv2：salt-api的替代品，运行在salt-master节点
* salt：基于redis pub/sub重构优化的salt命令
* saltx：官方原生salt命令，已废弃

RPM打包
===============

* 安装rpm：yum install rpmdevtools && yum install -y rpm-build && rpmdev-setuptree
* 创建rpm工作区目录：
    ~/rpmbuild/BUILD  ~/rpmbuild/BUILDROOT  ~/rpmbuild/RPMS  ~/rpmbuild/SOURCES  ~/rpmbuild/SPECS  ~/rpmbuild/SRPMS
* 修改/salt/pkg/rpm下salt.spec文件：Version以及%global srcver字段修改为新版本号
* 修改/salt/_version.py中版本号，与salt.spec一致
* 将/salt打包为salt-x.x.x.tar.gz，将salt-x.x.x.tar.gz放入/root/rpmbuild/SOURCES/
* 将/salt/pkg/rpm/下所有文件放入/root/rpmbuild/SOURCES/
* 进入/salt/pkg/rpm/，执行rpmbuild -bb salt.spec
* 构建好的rpm包在/root/rpmbuild/RPMS/noarch/下

RPM安装
===============
* 说明：使用yum本地安装模式
* 步骤：将RPM包放入任意目录下，执行：yum localinstall salt-2019.1.18-1.el7.centos.noarch.rpm salt-master-2019.1.18-1.el7.centos.noarch.rpm salt-minion-2019.1.18-1.el7.centos.noarch.rpm salt-syndic-2019.1.18-1.el7.centos.noarch.rpm salt-maid-2019.1.18-1.el7.centos.noarch.rpm
